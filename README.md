# OpenLayers Typescript Implementation

This is just a toy project to play with OpenLayers and Typescript.

## Motivation

OpenLayers is a beautiful library.

As a way to explore it and learn more about it, I decided to convert its code
to Typescript. This is not intended to be a drop-in replacement for OpenLayers.

## How it differs from OpenLayers

Most of the code was copied from OpenLayers and then converted to Typescript.
Things were moved around, some stuff was removed, and some new stuff was added.

I started with the most basic code that was deposited in the `@olts/core`
package.
